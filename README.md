# Output_Prediction-xy
Prediction of output 'y' for the given input 'x', based on the training dataset.

This program needs a dataset file as an input, where 'x' and its corresponding 'y' values are present.
During training process the program will fetch the 'x' and corresponding 'y' values from the dataset file and after doing some calculation it will create a prediction model.
After the training process, when we provide an unknown input 'x', according to the model it will predict the output 'y'.
