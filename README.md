# Output_Prediction-xy
Prediction of output 'y' for the given input 'x', based on the training dataset.

This program needs a training dataset as an input, where 'x' and corresponding 'y' values are present.
During the training process, program will fetch 'x' and corresponding 'y' values from the dataset and after doing some calculation it will create a prediction model.
After the training process, when we provide an unknown input 'x', based on the created model it will predict the output 'y'.
